\section{Conclusions}
The discovery of Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities demonstrated that the neverending run for higher perfomances must be backed up by a thorough security check on what type of exploits this can lead to. 
Four years passed since their discovery, and researchers still find new ways to leverage speculative execution.
It is clear that a Spectre-and-Meltdown-proof CPU is still far from being achieved, but a positive side effect is that the research for new microarchitectural bugs has been incentivized, and this resulted in the recent discovery of PACMAN vulnerability in new M1 chips.
